        Los Angeles is a city in the state of California in the west coast of
        the US facing the Pacific Ocean, it has a population of almost 4 million
        people, the county of LA is the third largest metropolitan economy of
        the world. Some studies have found that if every single human of the
        Earth lined up shoulder to shoulder they would fit in the area of the
        city which is roughly around 3000 squared kilometers. During the XIX
        century the city became the centre of show business of the US and the
        western world, in the end of the 800’s the famous city of Hollywood was
        founded by a certain Hobart Whitley, who’s considered the father of
        Hollywood, near LA; with the advent of the film industry the small ranch
        of Hollywood became the Mecca of American cinema where most of the
        actors and producers moved permanently.

          The traditional cultures of LA are the latino and indigenous ones,
          with the arrival of the 20th century and the influence of the film
          industry the culture became more and more global, a mix of different
          culture from aroun the globe. LA is a city that thanks to
          philantropist and benefactors, has several museums and important
          places in term of elitist culture, such as painting and sculpture.

          led to the emergence of hipster neighborhoods an example is Melrose
          Aveue, which is located between Beverly Hills and Santa Monica, where

          resturants with ethnic cousine. Another important aspect of Los
