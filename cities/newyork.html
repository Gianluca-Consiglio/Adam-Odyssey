        New York City is located in the state of New York on the east cost
        facing the atlantic ocean, it’s formed by five districts (Bronx,
        Mahattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island). Almost 8.7 millions people
        live here, and it’s considered as the most important city of the east
        coast. It’s is “The Big Apple”, which in italian is translated to “La
        Grande Mela”, because during the 1800’s the north of the USA, and
        especially N.Y., was seen as the more developed part of the country
        because the U.S.A. was compared to a tree as a metaphor, in which the
        southerner states where the trunk and the roots of the economy while the
        northerners states were the “fruits” of the economy and the more
        developed sector of the economy.

          New York is a cauldron of different ethnicities, religions , languages
          (such as italian, spanish, english of course etc…). It is known to be
          very chaotic at times, traffic jams are very frequent even though a
          large part of citizens don’t own a car. The most popular mean of
          trasportation is by far is the famous NY underground, which is the
          most extensive metropolitan system in the world, another alternative
          is the use of the classic yellow taxi which you can find literally in
          every street of the city. Every year since 1970, usually in autumn,
          the city is the host of the most partecipated marathon in the world,
          also in the city you can follow different sport franchises such as:
